Hi,

The folder Project 7 contains code for this OpenClassrooms project 7.

P7_notebook is a google colab notebook containing all the code from preprocessing to prediction

main.py uses streamlit for the front end of the credit rating dashboard

app.py uses flask for the back end

The working dashboard is available on streamlit share: https://c038644-git-main-4wr9um.streamlitapp.com/

The back end runs on heroku

Thanks.
